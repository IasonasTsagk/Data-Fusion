# Data Fusion Techniques for Plastic Types Classification
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify plastic types based on their Resin Identification Codes (RIC) using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) signals and categorical descriptors. The dataset consists of 373 samples obtained from household plastics, where each sample is labeled with one of the following RIC classes:
1: PET 2: HDPE 3: PVC 4: LDPE 5: PP 6: PS 7: Other 8: Unknown (optional to include/exclude)

The goal is to explore data fusion techniques to improve classification performance.
