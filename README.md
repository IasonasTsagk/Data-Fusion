# Data Fusion Techniques for Plastic Types Classification
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify plastic types based on their Resin Identification Codes (RIC) using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) signals and categorical descriptors. The dataset consists of 373 samples obtained from household plastics, where each sample is labeled with one of the following RIC classes:
1: PET 
2: HDPE 
3: PVC 
4: LDPE 
5: PP 
6: PS 
7: Other 

8: Unknown (optional to include/exclude)

The goal is to explore data fusion techniques to improve classification performance.

üìÇ Dataset Details

Features:

Spectral Data: Near-Infrared measurements recorded at different wavelengths.

Categorical Descriptors: Color, Transparency, and Recording Device Identifier.

Spectral Processing: The spectrum is calculated using: specktrum = sample_raw / wr_raw

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mid-Level Fusion (PCA + Categorical Features)

Feature Extraction:

PCA applied to spectral data to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.

Combined PCA-transformed features with categorical descriptors (color, transparency).

Classifier: Random Forest
Best Model: 33 PCA Componentsm, F1-Score = 0.8177

2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Fusion (Model Ensemble + Bayesian Consensus)

Base Models:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Fusion Technique: Bayesian Consensus to combine multiple classifiers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Embeddings Approach

Used feature embeddings extracted from an autoencoder.

Compared performance against PCA-based Mid-Level Fusion.
